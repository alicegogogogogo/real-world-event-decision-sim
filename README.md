# Real-world Event Decision Simulator

A small backend foundation for an emergency-response and logistics decision simulation platform. The service exposes a public HTTP entry point that future features can extend without changing the startup contract.

## Run

Requires Python 3.11 or newer and has no third-party runtime dependencies.

```bash
python -m event_sim serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Check the public health endpoint:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

## Test

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Public interface

- `GET /health` returns JSON with the service name and `ok` status.
- Unknown paths return a JSON `not_found` error with HTTP 404.
- `python -m event_sim --help` documents the command-line entry point.
