# Real-world Event Decision Simulator

A small backend foundation for an emergency-response and logistics decision simulation platform. The service exposes a public HTTP entry point that future features can extend without changing the startup contract.

## Run

Requires Python 3.11 or newer and has no third-party runtime dependencies.

```bash
python -m event_sim serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Check the public health endpoint:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

## Test

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Public interface

- `GET /health` returns JSON with the service name and `ok` status.
- Unknown paths return a JSON `not_found` error with HTTP 404.
- `python -m event_sim --help` documents the command-line entry point.

## Event ledger

Events are held only in the server process: restarting (or starting a new
instance) begins with an empty ledger.

### `POST /events`

Requires `Content-Type: application/json`. The body must be a JSON object with
exactly these five top-level fields:

| Field          | Rule                                      |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `eventId`      | non-empty string                          |
| `organizationId` | non-empty string                        |
| `type`         | non-empty string                          |
| `occurredAt`   | non-negative integer (no floats, no booleans) |
| `payload`      | JSON object                               |

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/events \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"eventId":"evt-1","organizationId":"org-1","type":"incident.created","occurredAt":100,"payload":{"severity":"low"}}'
```

- `201 Created` — new event stored; the response is the same five-field JSON.
- `200 OK` — the same `eventId` was resubmitted with identical fields; the
  stored event is returned and nothing is added.
- `409 Conflict` (`{"error": "event_id_conflict"}`) — the `eventId` exists but
  the other fields differ.
- `415 Unsupported Media Type` — missing or unsupported `Content-Type`.
- `400 Bad Request` — body is not syntactically valid JSON.
- `422 Unprocessable Entity` — fields are missing, extra, or invalid
  (arrays at the top level, blank identifiers, floats, etc.).

### `GET /events?organizationId=...`

The `organizationId` query parameter must appear exactly once and be non-empty.
Returns `200` with `{"organizationId": "...", "events": [...]}`, where events
belong only to that organization and are sorted by `occurredAt`, then
`eventId`. An unknown organization returns `"events": []`. A missing, blank, or
duplicated parameter yields `422`.
